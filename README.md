Prerequisites
=============
To use the theme, you'll need to use the Quilmes branch of SproutCore that has an updated rendering infrastructure.
You can obtain the Quilmes branch the following way:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore-abbot.git abbot
    $ cd abbot
    $ rake init
    $ mkdir frameworks
    $ cd frameworks
    $ git clone git://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore.git sproutcore
    $ cd sproutcore
    $ git checkout quilmes
    $ git pull
    
You can now run commands the following way (from your app):
    $ ../abbot/bin/sc-server

*NOTICE*: If your app has a copy of sproutcore in its frameworks directory, that version needs to
updated with one that supports renderers (e.g Quilmes).

Usage
=====
In your project, run the following commands
    mkdir -p themes
    cd themes
    git clone git@github.com:frekw/slick.git slick

Then add the following line to your Buildfile
    config :theme => :slick

Building
========
To generate new versions of the theme, you need RMagick.

To install rmagick, first install imagemagick, and then install the rmagick gem.
The easiest way to install imagemagick is by using homebrew [http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew].
Make sure you have XCode installed and run:
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsS http://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"
and then run
   brew install imagemagick


Slick also requires Ruby 1.9.2, which you can get via rvm [http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/].
Once rvm is installed, use the following command to install Ruby 1.9.2:

    $ rvm install 1.9.2
    
Or, the following command if you're on a mac (to enable CarbonCore extensions)
    $ rvm install 1.9.2 --enable-shared=yes

Then use
    $ rvm use 1.9.2
or
    $ rvm use 1.9.2 --default
to use it as the system's default.

Install the prerequisites for SproutCore by running the following command

    $ gem install mongrel --pre
    $ gem install rack jeweler json_pure extlib erubis thor rspec

*NOTICE:* Don't install rvm gems using sudo.


To build the theme, use
    $ ./build
also, make sure that build is allowed to run as an executable by running the following command
    $ chmod +x build
